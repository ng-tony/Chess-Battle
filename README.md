Basically chess with powerups.

## Run

Start with `yarn start`

## Powerups

* Guard: Captures pieces that walk into it's available squares
* Shield: Piece cannot be captured
* Sword: Movement will capture pieces directly adjacent to it's landing spot
* Flail: Movement will capture pieces diagonally adjacent to it's landing spot
    
## How to play

Make your own rules

Regular rules + add one powerup at the end of the turn?

Powerup takes a move?

Should you be able to stack powerups? Take powerups from your opponents?
